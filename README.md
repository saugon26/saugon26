## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal README. 
I'm a system administrator working towards one-day becoming a DEVOPS Security Engineer.
Currently I'm working on finishing my Associates in CS, with Python being the main language I've been using. 

I'm eager about learning new things so I never shy away from a challenge.

One of the most thrilling and exciting experiences I've had was joining the Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department in my community. It was incredibly rewarding to serve and help those in need in my community. 
The thrill of responding to a house fire and racing against time to help those in danger was unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever experienced. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of being there for others in their most vulnerable moments.

I look forward to mentorship and learning from others!
